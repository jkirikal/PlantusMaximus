* Ultrasonic sensor for calculating the water level in the tank
* Two plant growing lamps that automatically turn on/off
* A water pump and plastic tubes for irrigating the plants when the moisture is too low
* A Raspberry Pi camera module for capturing timelapse video
* Raspberry Pi for controlling the system and hosting a web server
